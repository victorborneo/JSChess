I coded chess... **again**... but better :)

If you want to add chess to your website (_for some reason_) I guess you can use this one

Just create a canvas in your html and copy this project. Also, change the 'canvasId' variable in _consts.js_ to the id of your canvas HTML element.

That should do it... I think

Ah, I haven't implemented draw by repetition or insufficient material. Not because it's hard or anything, I just thought those were lame rules lmao. Maybe I'll add them someday
